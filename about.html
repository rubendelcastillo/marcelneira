								  <p class="mb-0">
								My love and passion for food are woven into my very DNA. Born in 1985 in Barcelona, I grew up surrounded by a rich culinary tradition, largely influenced by my grandmother, who cooked for  affluent families and schools. From an early age, I recognized the diversity and richness of our gastronomic culture. My close relatives have owned a restaurant in Barcelona for over 30 years, and my time there ignited my curiosity for the hospitality and restaurant sector.
</p>
<p class="mb-0">
I embarked on my professional culinary journey at the age of 16 as a dishwasher and kitchen assistant. Although I did not complete my formal studies in culinary arts, I was meticulous in my choices, prioritizing knowledge, technique, and professionalism over high salaries. Over the next 12 years, I gained valuable experience working in various kitchens throughout the neighborhoods of Barcelona, particularly in El Maresme.
</p>
<p class="mb-0">
Eventually, I decided to relocate to the Netherlands, specifically Maastricht, where I began my culinary career in Spanish restaurants. This led to opportunities in French cuisine, culminating in a three-year tenure at a Michelin-starred restaurant, predominantly in the banqueting section of Ch√¢teau Neercanne.
<p>
<p class="mb-0">
After eight rewarding years in Maastricht, I sought a new adventure in The Hague, near the beach, a place that felt like home. Unfortunately, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic presented significant challenges, as restaurant closures greatly impacted my career expectations and took time for me to mentally recover.
</p>
<p>
However, with the pandemic came new opportunities. I decided to embrace the freelance lifestyle, offering a wide array of services. My experience ranges are  from working as a cook and chef to creating innovative menus for restaurants and training existing staff. The possibilities are endless, and I am dedicated to bringing my culinary expertise to new heights.
